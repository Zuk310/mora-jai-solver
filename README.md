## üìñ About The Project

This project is a dedicated tool for players of the game _Blue Prince_. It provides an interface to replicate any in-game Mora Jai puzzle and uses an intelligent **A\* (A-star) search algorithm** to find the most optimal solution.

By running the solver in a background thread, the application remains perfectly responsive even when tackling the most complex puzzles.

## ‚ú® Features

- **‚ö° Intelligent A\* Solver**: Implements the A\* search algorithm with a heuristic to intelligently find the shortest solution path.
- **üí™ Non-Blocking UI**: The entire solver process runs in a background Web Worker, ensuring the user interface is always smooth and responsive, even during complex calculations.
- **‚èπÔ∏è Cancelable Searches**: Gives the user full control to abort a puzzle search that is taking too long, providing an excellent user experience.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Full Puzzle Editor**: Recreate any puzzle from the game by clicking on tiles and realm cores to change their colors in "Edit Mode".
- **üïπÔ∏è Interactive Grid**: Play and solve the puzzles manually directly in the browser to test your own theories.
- **üé® Themed & Modern UI**: The user interface is designed to be clean, modern, and aesthetically aligned with the _Blue Prince_ game style.
